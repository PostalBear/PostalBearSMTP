# PostalBearSMTP
Poorly implemented SMTP server.

Inspired by SubethaSmtp, build on top of Grizzly framework ...<br/>
Due to amount of hacks and bad architecture in general, should not be ever used at all.<br/>
<b>I warned you ! :)</b> 

If you think that it is stil make sense to take a look, well, I can't prevent you from this.
